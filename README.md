EFI file to make MacOS or (Hackintosh) work on a Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 6 (Kaby lake).

I've been using MacOS on this thinkpad for 2 months now and I can tell that works like a Mac, the only downside is that if you have the 2k display you will have to install hidpi

Note: Generate SMBIOS and enable show picker if you want.

Unfortunately Sonoma and Sequoia don't work but I will try to fix this with time.
